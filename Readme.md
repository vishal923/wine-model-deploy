Project: Model Deployment for Wine Quality Data

About the DataSet:

Size of the DataSet : 1599 records * 12 features

The datasets consist of several features include:

volatile acidity : Volatile acidity is the gaseous acids present in wine.

fixed acidity : Primary fixed acids found in wine are tartaric, succinic, citric, and malic.

residual sugar : Amount of sugar left after fermentation.

citric acid : It is weak organic acid, found in citrus fruits naturally.

chlorides : Amount of salt present in wine.

free sulfur dioxide : So2 is used for prevention of wine by oxidation and microbial spoilage.

total sulfur dioxide : is the amount of free + bound forms of SO2.

pH : In wine pH is used for checking acidity.

density : sweeter wines have a higher density.

sulphates : Added sulfites preserve freshness and protect wine from oxidation, and bacteria.

alcohol : Percent of alcohol present in wine.

quality : Quality of the wine

What we have done:

1.Load the data

2.Clean the data

3.Split the data

4.Train the model

5.Save the model(in pickle file)

6.Using flask for this model 

7.Deploy the model in heroku.
